# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install


## create databse in own databse use mysql
CREATE DATABASE school_directory;


### Key Updates:
1. **Installation Instructions**: Added `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. **MySQL Setup**: Added detailed instructions for setting up MySQL, creating the `school_directory` database, and creating a `schools` table.
3. **Database Connection**: Instructions for configuring the database connection in a `db.js` file and using it in API routes like `getSchools.js`.
4. **API Integration**: Example code for fetching data from the database via the API route `getSchools.js`.

With these changes, you can follow the updated `README.md` to get started with the project, set up the database, and run the server.
